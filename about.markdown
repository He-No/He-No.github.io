First of all, I am a cybersecurity enthusiast, with a focus on penetration testing (employed by the Security Factory), with hands-on experience in Infrastructure, WebApp, Binary and WiFi environments. Besides this great job, I am active as an esports manager focusing on the CS:GO division of KRC Genk.

I am very grateful and happy that I can spend most of my time practicing my two hobbies on a daily basis. There is no such thing as a free lunch, to get what you want you have to work hard. But I can say first hand that hard work pays off!
